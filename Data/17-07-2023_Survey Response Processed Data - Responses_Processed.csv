Access to a pdf document that we can print off as a handbook to make notes on during the course.
I think it would be useful also if the examples used in the course were the  same as the ones in the tutorial
I spent a lot of time typing in commands and checking them so a list of copy and paste commands would save this time. It was quite frustrating
The presenters moved through very quickly but were very patient when questions were asked.
Even if there was a brief online youtube clip of how the R interface and windows are organised it would help as I found this a bit hard to grasp as well.

Course prereqs should include an elementary understanding of how to use the command line as, again, a lot of time was wasted explaining simple concepts like how to change directory. A 2 page document explaining the fundamental basics perhaps with screenshots to show people how to open putty, put in the IP address and login to the virtual machine and made available to people before the course would have been very helpful.

It would be good to have a link to some more advanced material would also be helpful for people who are able to grasp these kinds of concepts quickly and can use the time otherwise spent doing nothing waiting around for everyone else to further their knowledge ",InPerson,"AG, WC",UTS,SQL101,,2018,2,6,24,Fri,22,18,,0.5,SQL,43266_UTS_SQL101

I'm new to coding and was told that it would be ok to attend. However, the intro did not provide theory or structure of how R works, what the commands mean (apply, function, types of parentheses and when to use etc.). Therefore, today was more difficult than it needed to be. It would be great to have concepts and theory before we start writing code so we can understand the logic of R. Also, more opportunity to practice in the sessions to help consolidate learning. Lastly, we're trying to watch, listen and type. Giving more time to type commands etc would be good. Great that you had an extra instructor in the room to give individual help. Today's tutor was great! Lastly, using an example all way through to provide context/relevance would be very useful.

I felt like most of the items we spent time on were not things that I, or anyone, will ever need to use. While I can understand that it is a general course so needs to be broad enough to apply to people from different degrees, I think that a more cohesive and clear introduction is needed that leads you through a specific scenario applying all the things we are learning. 
For example, there was a whole section on converting temperatures but it came out of nowhere and I really didn't understand where it fits in with learning to use R on my data. 
It would have been good to build a whole narrative around the inflammation data and frame the activities around this",1,Maybe it would be better to break it into introductions to different applications of R programming,InPerson,"AG, JZ",UON,R101,,2018,4,10,40,Thu,27,21,,1,R,43377_UON_R101

As we were basically following along with the teacher's code, I think you could potentially actually showcase more advanced queries of the data while still using it to explain basic concepts such as difference between round and square bracket, if else functions etc. This would make me feel more confident in walking away that I knew now how to apply the code to my own data to look at things I wanted to do.

The instructors also related the concepts/features we were learning about to why we might need to use them - which is really useful to help us see how using the features might be good for our research.","Occasionally, the instructor went a little bit too fast and didn't explain what they were typing/doing.

I also really liked how we stepped through simple functions at first, doing mean, max and min, then moved on to more complex functions like loops and conditionals. Everytime we used a more useful function, we went back to old scripts that we wrote and added it back to make the old scripts simpler (putting conditionals into the inflammation_loop or putting the analyse function back into the inflammation_loop). In the end, we made a complex script to analyse the inflammation data that included all the functions we learnt about.

It was also good that the presenter brought the purpose of the workshop back at the end - to help us research better.","For those who've attended intersect workshops for other languages, it was slightly repetitive to learn about loops, conditionals and functions again.

Also, the easiest part at the beginning of the course was super slow. I believe that most of us have some computer skills to understand the beginning part quite quickly.

And then, where slower pace was needed in the middle of the course, it was too fast. 

Obviously, what is needed in terms of the speed is to start relatively quickly (because there is nothing much in there), and then slow down when the ""real"" content begins.

Most people were unable to connect when using the usyd, usyd-guest or eduroam networks. However, connection via private mobile tethering worked fine. Incidentally, I was initially unable to connect to this feedback form - it turns out my phone connection had closed and my laptop had reverted to the uni wifi. I could only connect after changing my internet connection to be via my phone. Very strange! Malcolm managed to get most of the class to download miniconda and helped us get set up on both macs and PCs. Very impressive!
* It would have been very helpful if Josephine was regularly monitoring the room to see if anyone needed help. Most of the time she was very focused on her laptop and didn't appear to be checking the room. She was very helpful when we asked her, but I was at the same table as her so it wasn't hard for me. There were a number of times when Malcolm had to stop the class to respond to a question that it seemed like would have been handled better by Josephine. This was also the case in another Intersect class at USYD I attended earlier in the week. I ended up helping one of the class members connect to the usyd-guest wifi - but ideally should have been handled by Josephine. More active monitoring of the clas, and walking around so those further away get help too, will make a big difference to participants.

2 - I would provide some pre-reading for background knowledge on things like the normal distribution, parametric vs non-parametric tests, brief intro to Syntax maybe and also the difference between chi squared for fit and chi squared for independence. Perhaps also provide the online course materials link before the course to read up on before we attend.

3 - I would email students online links before the course so they can copy and paste into their browser instead of typing them as this seemed to be a challenge for some members of the class. 

4 - I did not agree with my classmate who expressed his opinion that he would never use chi squared and was ""confused"" - I thought this section was very good and useful! I also thought that the way the student presented his opinion was challenging and the teacher showed excellent teaching skills in the professional way he received the comment.

5 - The teacher was excellent at correcting himself if he made a mistake, this takes maturity and the subject is difficult to teach and errors are expected, he could even state at the beginning that if any student notices and error or has a query then he welcomes that, because statistics and IT teaching is like that, it is easy to make a small factual mistake during the flow of teaching which a student might notice but the teacher has not.

I'm still not sure how to use the linked data you sent us and I don't actually even know what you sent us because your Zoom screen overtook my whole screen and I could not access downloads (although I did find the download by using Ctrl J). Those sort of steps are completely new so they need to be shown more deliberately and slowly for those online. If you are looking at your own project screen while you click on yours, then you miss the whole thing - so maybe wiggle the mouse on the spot for a few seconds before clicking? A few screenshots sent out would be ideal. I never got my longitudinal instrument going so didn't get to do any of the steps you did this afternoon (I did everything in the morning session OK). So once you miss the crucial first steps it is game over! I did still listen to all you said and watched the screen and took screenshots, so it was not a waste of time for me. When Paul Fulbrook and I use Redcap, we know we can contact you for any parts we need clarification. Thank you, Sandra Miles

I am a beginner and day 1 was paced very well. It seemed more rushed on day 2 and some key functions of R being discussed. I think the 2 mornings format worked really well but wonder if day 2 should be extended a little to accommodate slower learners like me!
From a technology point of view - it was really easy, just a few issues with sound on day 1 but this did not detract from the teaching material or the delivery.
I have done a few courses now and this really ranks as one of the best - careful pacing, great notes (which I was annotating in R (very useful)) and very attentive instructors.

So much time was wasted going over the most basic things - what a variable is, that you'd only need to change thefilename if you need to analyse a different file with the same code. That variable names are irrelevant so long as they're kept consistent (for instance you don't need to say number = 1, you can call it anything so long as you keep that name consistent, defining a function doesn't run it, the list goes on... 

The course design was terrible because the emphasis was on trying to do something basic like analyse a bit of data rather than learn the essential fundementals required to do anything at all first then apply it to analyse some data. Any basic programming website would have covered the same fundemental basics for absolute beginners far more clearly and efficiently. It would be far more efficient and helpful for everyone if you had a half day course on ""fundementals of programming"" (in python cos it's a really simple language) as a prereq for all intro programming courses so everyone is at the same level and they could be run as 2 half day courses.

Learning these things in R can often be a lot of trial and error and the language is sometimes difficult to understand so the explanation and examples in this course were very informative,,10,Malcolm and Khuong were my instructors and they were honestly awesome. I really liked that they tried a few things in the course that they didn't know if it would work and things that didn't. I think this is really important as a new user learning because it gives you confidence as a lot of it are trial and error!

",8,"The only issue with the training today was that the attendees were at different levels of skills and while the majority were similar, there were a few that were at the very basic level. This unfortunately created a lot of frustration for me because we were dealing with the same people over and over again. I think this course should have a prerequisite in that the attendees should at least know how to copy and paste data etc. I spent a lot of time just waiting for those few to catch up and it gave me a headache by the end. I am ok with going over something more than once but the issues we had today were different and some people needed to be shown how to copy a range of data over and over again. So while I absolutely loved the way Charlotte was teaching - clear and appropriate pace - she was being forced to literally teach some people how to use Excel and that was frustrating. I know Jianzhou tried to take those individuals into the Breakout rooms several times, but that created another problem so when they came back, they again behind others because they missed the new things were were learning with Charlotte during that time. Sorry everyone, I am just frustrated because I waited a long time for this course and it was just ruined for me by a handful of attendees who took over the session - literally. I do hope you offer another course on what to do next because I am very interested in learning about other features of Excel too.

I would suggest not using binary gender as the branching example to ensure that the training is inclusive to all.

",Most of the other parts except what is noted for the previous question. This is because I am very familiar with Nvivo and I teach others how to use Nvivo for qualitative data management. ,8,"As an introductory course, this was excellent. I would recommend it for anyone who is thinking of using Nvivo for their data analysis. However, the focus was solely on the functionality of Nvivo and from this point of view it was excellent. I felt there wasn't enough emphasis on the intricacies of qualitative research. I realise this isn't the purpose of the course. But I think it is very important for the trainers to emphasize that NVivo is just a tool to manage qualitative data and the analysis itself is by the researcher.  That it is important not to over rely on some of the Nvivo functionalities. I felt there was a much more quantitative approach to using Nvivo emphasised. This can mislead participants on how Nvivo can be used and give participants the idea that Nvivo is actually doing the analysis, which it is not. I also felt there was an assumption on the trainer's part that participants are already familiar with Nvivo and some of the terms used in Nvivo. Even for me, someone who has been training others in the use of Nvivo for more than 5 years, I felt the training was going too fast. Those who are not so tech savvy and familiar with this kind of software,  can easily get lost.  It would be good in the future, to keep on checking with participants if they are following and keeping up with the trainers. Again I realise within the three hours, it is not possible to take it any slower. Perhaps trainers need to continue emphasising throughout the training that this is just an introduction only.  I will recommend this for HDR candidates and staff who need a quick introduction to Nvivo. But for them to learn how to use Nvivo for data analysis, I think it is essential to provide follow up training with some of the qualitative data analysis concepts integrated into the training.

I felt the instructor didn't have a clear plan for the course - mainly, how best to explain functions & have us practice the functions. I felt the instructor's plan for how best to use the time was subpar - in a 3 hr course I expect to come away with more than just an understanding of how to use only a few basic functions. The instructor misunderstood a couple of questions which led to another round of explaining/providing examples in some cases. There were too many technical issues from the instructor's end - bad connection, files not downloading correctly, audio was breaking up, the instructor had to leave the session for ~10 minutes etc. For example, when a file didn't download correctly, the instructor spent too much time on-the-line trying to fix it (we should have just moved on).

I will then need to compare the comments of people who answered yes to closed ended questions about vulnerability to abuse and experience of abuse in the last 3 years.,"I guess because I had done a bit of exploring in Nvivo already and gone through the steps to import my data, I was a bit further along in my understanding of these functions of Nvivo, but I understand this was a very 'beginners' course so it needs to cover this stuff. I do wonder if, like me, many of the attendees of this course had opened Nvivo and had a bit of a play with it and therefore less time could be spent on this end of the course and more time spent on coding and comparing data, getting outputs for our research projects. I will definitely be asking for access to an intermediate course to further explore these.",8,"It is a great shame that not more people were willing to turn on their videos for the zoom session. It must make it hard for the trainers too, to gauge the audience's reactions (looking confused, or lost). I had my video on to start with but turned it off after the only other person on video turned theirs off. I have gotten a lot more out of training where there was a free flow of ideas and questions, but this is a whole new world we are adjusting to. You can't make people interact but perhaps encouraging people to be visible and use a hand up system as if we were in a room together would help (I think zoom has this function), along with an ice breaker chat encouraging everyone giving a quick intro of themselves and why they want to learn Nvivo.

It might be useful to provide pre-workshop learning material to better prepare participants. Also, frequent (and timed) breaks are essential for such long sessions, so hopefully that would be integrated into the slides or something (just to remind the presenter to take a breather). Might be a good idea to skip polynomial regression modelling (and simply just suggest that it is an option?) since it took quite a bit of time to run that session, yet all it tried to explain was that there are other models that may better fit the data (polynomial models are rarely used anyway since nonlinear regression models are almost always preferred, right?) 

It might also be a good idea for the presenter to emhpasise comments and commenting code (I was doing it while learning the code) as it helps the participants retain the information better? Finally, great work on the vms, made the entire session much smoother than usual (in past programming workshops that I atteneded not by Intersect, troubleshooting individual computers wasted a lot of time).",,,,PYTHON205,,2020,4,11,48,Wed,,,,1,Python,44160__PYTHON205

This is my second Qualtrics session. The first was very confusing as I was trying to switch between zoom and Qualtrics screens on the one computer. This time I was not using 2 screens which enabled me to have a 'hands on' experience - this is my primary mode of learning for anything 'technical'. After this session I feel more confident to be able to navigate my way around the program in a basic sense and explore possibilities, but I will certainly be joining later training sessions to get help with the many gaps in my knowledge of the program and experience with using it. Unfortunately, I won't be  available for another session this year, and for me it's probably best that I digest today's learning before trying to take in more. I will launch my survey at the beginning of the autumn season so I will try to set it up in Qualtrics over the next week and send to you to have a quick look if you have time. The analysis training will be very helpful some time in first semester 2021 if its available then. ",Online,XW,WSU,QLTRICS101,,2020,4,11,48,Fri,21,15,,0.5,Qualtrics,44162_WSU_QLTRICS101

The presenter, Charlotte was a really helpful, kind and calm instructor. Also there were a number of participants that struggled with following along and many basic steps needed repeating, so perhaps it would be good to offer two courses that covered differing needs.

Our course ran from 10am to 3pm and we only had two 10 minute breaks in this time. I really needed a lunch break and more frequent breaks, and found it extremely difficult to concentrate and to retain information in the last 2 hours, which is a shame because the content was quite important for my research and the instructor was extremely knowledgeable and a good communicator in general. More frequent breaks would really help people take in the information being offered and would make for far better learning outcomes overall.

The training was also done on the current version of qualtrics, but this version is being updated and we are all being switched over to the new version next month. I think the training would have been even more useful if it had been on the new version of the software, as I think there will be some growing pains as I try to translate what I learnt in the training onto a new version and interface of the program.",Online,JL,Deakin,QLTRICS101,,2021,2,4,17,Thu,14,12,Solo,0.5,Qualtrics,44308_Deakin_QLTRICS101

Also, this isn't a shortcoming of the course at all, as the course never stated that they were offering this (and in fact when I asked about it, I was given several helpful resources and an offer to email as well, which was great!) - but it would be really cool if we could maybe one day be able to use some data that would help us show how we can apply R to research in our specific field (e.g. linguistics for me). This may be too specific and not possible, but I just thought I'd mention it because I love the way the course is taught and this style is a lot easier for me to follow than reading about how to do it.

I have taught in schools for about 20 years and seen many different teaching styles.  Jerry is very clear with his explanations, makes sure all participants are up to date, provides extra information especially designed for those who might not be able to type so fast, or who have slower internet connections.  He's more than happy to go back over something a participant might have missed.  One of the best teachers I've encountered.  10 gold stars!!!
I don't have access to a statistician within my faculty (studying Marine Science) so analyses would be good.  I'd like to start with working out what type of data I have (or am likely to collect) and how different types of data should/can be analysed.  Right now I could do with help understanding Generalised Linear Models.  I think I need to use these for my data, but haven't yet been able to understand any information I've found online - it's all too advanced.
Thank you, too, to Susan who helped everything run smoothly.

How to code using words and themes and creating sub-codes (weird that it used the word 'children'). How to use NCapture,I think that it is very unprofessional that Shaun was teaching from his bedroom - he hadn't even bothered to make his bed properly. We didn't use the breakout rooms. THE most annoying and frustrating thing was Shaun was using  a much earlier version of NVivo program so I couldn't find things quickly or easily when he was showing what to do. I have a visual memory so when his screen is totally different to mine it was frustrating and confusing. He also ran through things very fast without verbally saying where his mouse was and what he was clicking on. I had to keep switching from the Zoom shared screen page to my NVivo program and kept missing things because he just expected people to see what he was doing on the page. Having a half/ half screen up was not good enough to follow where his mouse was actually going. Shaun also started talking about transcription options and ethics IN THE MIDDLE OF SHOWING US HOW TO IMPORT A TRANSCRIPT! Need to talk about it and then show us how to do it. I think maybe showing us something and then letting us do it would be much better. Jeff did that with Qualtrics and it was a MUCH better format.  He also didn't show us about how to navigate from one page to the other - I had to bumble around on my own and find pathways. For example when doing a word search and moving from PDF to the list of files I found by accident that there are a multitude of files open and listed across the screen. While I have learnt some things I did not find this class very enjoyable to participate in.,8,,Online,SG,WSU,NVIVO101,,2021,3,7,31,Wed,43,33,Packaged,0.5,NVivo,44405_WSU_NVIVO101

There was little to no emphasis on ""replicable"" during the course, ie the course name being ""R for replicable research"".

this was my third intersect training course, and in conclusion it is not worth recommending, considering the hours required to attend and the poor quality of the instruction. it is better to spend the six hours doing self-paced learning via datacamp or codeacademy.

The instructors are nice people and genuinely want to help, but they are not professional  instructors and do not know how ineffective / inefficient their training is.  If someone asks a question the response should not be ""just google it"".  We are all busy and taking six hours out of our week to attend a training course is a big commitment, the expectation is that six hours of competent and efficient training is provided.  It is not expected to come away knowing how to code, however after one session we should be confident with how R / R Studio works, and where to access a good guide to continue learning.  You can tell by listening to the questions that many attendees simply do not understand the basics.

Perhaps the code for the day could be shared at the start so that we could choose how to follow along. If we wanted to code along, we could do this, but if we ran into problems, we wouldn't fall behind because we could just run the pre-prepared code already loaded? 
A brief reminder about the functions of R was good at the start (e.g., setting working directory). But just a little slower would have been perfect. I hadn't used R since the intro course so I needed a brief reminder to set working directory, but the speed of showing the process was too quick to actually look away from the screen, do it on my computer, then look back, and I'd missed a step!
Sometimes the pause between asking if anyone had questions and moving on was so quick that I couldn't even get to my unmute button or chat box in time :)",10,I would love to do Growth Mixture Modelling in R - the basics of finding trajectory groups in longitudinal data and then establishing predictors for the trajectories that emerge.,Online,SL,LTU,R203,,2021,3,8,35,Tue,20,15,Packaged,1,R,44432_LTU_R203

Instructors should consider how they are communicating info even if they are well versed with the software. Sometimes we would go into learn how to do something without understanding why it is useful or how it could be beneficial for managing the data. I didn't learn much more than what I had figured out for myself.

Attending the course, one would have no idea that the language has applications beyond quantitative methods, very narrowly construed.

It would be good if the instructor used a good quality headset with condenser mic - the sort that will cut out background noise (e.g. kids, keyboard noise). 

It would have been good to have 5 minutes to read a short explanation of ridge and lasso regression. Getting the concepts down is important, otherwise everything after that is built on sand. 

There was that one guy who didn't seem to have read the email 2 days before and hadn't installed the R packages, then kept asking questions when his code didn't work (several times). I've seen this in a few courses before -- there's often that one person. 

I would suggest that the main instructor shouldn't spend *any* time with unprepared people. There were several other Intersect people in the Zoom who helped him out, which was good, but I'm thinking he should have been taken into a breakout room the first time and taken through the install and R update process. Or given the script to update R and install the packages, and told to come back when he's done it. 

I know that may sound a bit unsympathetic, but there were 30 people on a course with difficult concepts and, for the inexperienced R users, unfamiliar code. It's a lot, and there shouldn't be time taken up by people who didn't bother reading an email, downloading a script and running it. 

OK, rant over. :-)

Again, let me say--really impressed with the course and with Intersect in general. I'm looking forward to the classification and SVM courses.

  In terms of the stages used to explain each algorithm - concepts, then toy dataset, then 'real' dataset - I found the explanation of the concepts to be most useful. Not what I was expecting! But having the concepts explained several ways - with equations, with graphics, with analogies - was great, and a good antidote to the ""cookbook approach"" where you know the steps but not why you are doing them. ","I don't think any part of the course was not useful. Even the parts where we were running fairly standard R code to clean and preprocess the data were important--you may not learn anything new about R but you do learn, for example, what the model requires as inputs, or what is a better approach out of all the technically possible approaches. 
  It would be good if the downloads were available before the course - that would make more time available for teaching. Also, it would have been good to reduce the dataset for the MNIST analysis still further; for me at least I spent a lot of time waiting for my laptop to run that analysis, and ended up just watching what Kuong was doing. ",10,"For this course (SVM and unsupervised learning with R), other that what I've mentioned above: make it longer. It should be two days like the other courses in the series. 

In general: 
- A sort of ergonomic point: it would be good if presenters wore headsets with condenser mics. They give clearer audio with fewer dropouts and less background noise, incl. less keyboard noise :-) 
-  The course materials are excellent. I have made a point of going over them again just after the courses have finished to solidify what I have learned. 
- courses which cover: 
  * DBSCAN
  * methods for longitudinal data analysis, e.g. multilevel regression and FDA
  * maybe deep learning? For me it's not likely to be something I'd use soon, but for others it might be. It is the most obvious absence from the catalogue, anyway.

As a total novice I would prefer, slower introduction, explanation of the uses and benefits of R with a few examples
When would it be advantageous to analyse and visualise data in R compared to using Excel, stats software. Personlly for me I think only face to face slow instruction would help me start to become confident of learning R.
The instuctors were very knowledgable and supportive, but for some their academic teaching experience was very new. I felt some other teaching aids and structure could have been used alongside looking at live typescripting in the R program most of the time.
Some pre-made slides in powerpoint for example with explanations may have improved learning outcomes",Online,TA,UNSW,R101,,2022,1,2,8,Wed,32,24,Packaged,1,R,44608_UNSW_R101

It actually gives an example of how to ‘explode’ a factor variable. However, the pivot needs to end up with representing the wall type at each of the interview dates. 

More generally, the most common datasets for social scientists are survey data with structure like the following. It would help if the course were structured around this.

A: One row per household with a household ID variable plus others
B: One row per person, with person ID and household ID variables plus others
C: Multiple rows per person, with a person ID and interview wave variable (integer), and variables (eg VarA, VarB etc).

The most useful data manipulations are then:
One to many join between A and B (ending up with one record per person, with person and household level variables)

Long to wide transformation of C. Ending up with one record per person, and with variables VarA_1, VarA_2 etc.

It is incredibly annoying to try and transcribe code that is only on screen for less than a minute at a time, so you can run the exercises yourself. This also takes away time and attention from what the instructor is saying.
* The MPI section was rushed through, when the introduction section could have been shortened to half an hour to make more time for the important parts later on.
* In the introduction section, the instructors present a common example of an embarrassingly parallel problem with multiple csv files that require processing in parallel, but then never go on to include an exercise about this type of real world problem. I'd like to see that included as an exercise, especially if you're going to make a big deal out of it at the beginning.
* There was no discussion or information provided about setting up your code environment with the right compilers, etc, or what you should enable on Gadi. I understand not wanting to spend workshop time on this, but attendees should have been pointed to some kind of resource about it, ideally before the workshop",5,"* The course registration page should have clearer information about what the pre-requisites actually are. This just had some very broad statements like ""Familiarity with C/Fortran"", instead of being more specific about what specific level of knowledge is needed in which areas. (It turns out that this workshop needs a tiny bit of C knowledge, but not much, and no Fortran is used at all)
* There was a dinging noise that went off repeatedly during the workshop. I'm not sure what it was - zoom announcing whenever someone joined or left the meeting? Maybe the presenter was getting slack notifications or similar?

Too much time was spent on the importance of data management .. This is known and needs to be shorter.,0,"There was confusion about the the ending  time of this course in the class among 4 staff ..why? The event bright app said it was 12.30pm .It was ended at 12.00. The first part was very generic and  probably didn't need to have so much time being spent i.e. importance of data management. The second more important part was rushed which is why people do the course i.e. Data management plan. This is typical bad organization and communication. There were literally 4 staff present too many cooks...and no much happening. I am not sure why? instead please calrify and get the logistics right. No time for questions etc. This is  a regular course ..get it right. This is definitely not rocket science.

Even though it technically ended early ..none of the staff had an time allocated for questions afterwards . 
How many staff are needed to monitor chats. 
Some of these excess staff were obviously NOT present and doing other work or distracted. Not good. 

Minor note a lot of the staff were friendly. But it is typical NFP behavior to not have good organization. Nathan McKinlay(staff) was a bit rude to a person who couldn't log by saying don't something like ""instead of  interrupting"" .this could have been communicated better . Noting the presenter did make it clear that it was a supportive session and she would take question ALONG THE way . It really created a atmosphere of people discouraged to actual ask questions.  staff need to be aware of their tone and how they communicate with students. Nathan was distracted cause of the follow up from the chat was not being done promptly. 

I felt the session was rush. Staff need to be more accountable about their role in the training AND this is not a side project, its part of their job. If you are going to be doing other things during the meeting  and not really be present …Do not be in the meeting. 
Some of the fundamental questions and the responses were generic. There is also more data than scientific data that needs to be stored. 
This harsh but needed . Overall the presenter and most staff have good intentions but its lost in bad organization. I am sure they are lovely people yes. this is the direct feedback.

My first and hopefully last intersect training. It has made intersect feel like an NFP designed to make money for the the people running it and absolve university of actually doing training and being accountable.  

This course could be a recorded video . People attend courses to ask questions etc. You need to allow for this or at least not rush critical parts .

Hopefully some actual action will occur from the meeting. A lot is not the course but logistics and management.

The lecture days are content heavy, in long blocks and in the afternoon. As someone with chronic illness and disability, I have not managed to attend the entirety of the two courses I've signed up for due to health reasons as they are presented in this format. When I inquired about recordings so I could catch up, I was informed to retake the course and try and work through it on my own. I'm not sure how many people with disabilities you are loosing by doing this, but I would not recommend intersect training due to this for anyone else. We get left out enough as it is, and getting given these barriers when trying to learn is incredibly disheartening. ",Online,KT,NCI,R206,,2022,2,5,22,Mon,38,30,Packaged,1,R,44704_NCI_R206

So I think my issues were quite specific.,"The pace was too fast for me and there were too many assumptions for my level. I spent more than an hour trying to understand what LOTR meant as a file name, for example, as I thought this was a file type like XML, PDF etc. The instructors' screen was so small - even when maxed to my full screen, that I could not read any of the buttons or tab names to be able to follow the details.  I was unable to implement any of the instructions that were given, so I just ended up watching  on. Nonetheless I was able to follow some aspects so I'm not sorry that I did it and I recognise that my level was far behind that of others.",8,"Anyone coming to NVivo for the first time would be hard pressed to have followed. Maybe this is not the right course. A very clear pitch of what prior knowledge is expected about this software package and skills levels assumed would be helpful. Would be good to explain to people how to view the instructors' screen so that we can follow - it was too small to see anything. Is this fixable? Maybe some basic housekeeping at the beginning to ensure people know how to enlarge the screen (I tried). Explanation of key terms/concepts used in the program. maybe some of this might be doable even before the day as preparation for this who need it? Now some comments as more an observer of the interactions than as a participant:  There were a lot of queries in the chat from  people who were unclear which were not engaged with, and there could have been more moments to stop and review. The instructor moved very fast and she did ask if people wanted a review from time to time.  But some people will never say yes in that situation, so review pauses and recaps could have been built in so no one had to ask at all and feel that they were holding up others. It is evident that not all were following, because each time someone was brave enough to say they had an issue, several more in the chat said they felt the same.

It appears that the @which function simply reported which line in the Jupyter notebook the code was coming from, so if the user goes back to a block of code in the Jupyter notebook and edits it to create a variant of a function, it seems the original is lost (i.e. fully overwritten). In other languages (e.g. C#, C++), overloading a function is managed in a much more sophisticated way. Also, I think better examples are needed to illustrate how this works, for example a version of a function where some of the arguments have different data types from the data types used in other versions.",8,"It's important not to forget readability. For example, the short-form syntax of the if-else syntax was used in one example, but the example would have been much clearer using the long form syntax.

Normally I am reluctant to ask questions, (and I also notice that sometimes ppl ask questions and they are not answered when in zoom teaching sessions because a teacher doesn't see the question) but in this intersect training session, questions were answered immediately - so no-one could get left behind. It was the BEST training session I have been to, in that it was relevant, immediately applicable but also that teachers were there to not just show but teach and assist. (I also loved that we weren't just shown, we could 'do', so the fact that we could interact by being supplied with the data sets etc was great. And I missed a day.. so the modules still being accessable means I can still learn this part, but also review what I learnt on the first day. Often I am so busy taking notes.. that I miss parts because note taking means you are slower than the speaker... but because the notes were supplied, this doesn't apply here. So great job INTERSECT.

In addition, some students did not have NVivo loaded on their computers - how does anyone attend a workshop to learn how to use a software program and not UNDERSTAND that they must have the software in question.

There were a few times where the primary instructor got diverted by questions that perhaps ought to have been held and answered at the end as they weren't directly related to what we were learning, or something along those lines, but it was also his first time teaching in this context from what I understand, so managing questions, people, and pacing etc come with time and practice. I think for a first time he did well :) 

One other thing, the approach of annotating what each part of the code was in the examples on the second day made things easier to follow as compared to the first, I would suggest that is standard practice as it helps others foster good practice and remember what all the parts are when they come back to their notes.

It could have been much clearer what the level of the course was going to be. I've just gone back to look at the event description; and while we did technically cover most of the things listed under ""You'll learn"", it definitely does not sound like you're going to be taught what rows and columns are and how to tell if a cell is selected. 2. A suggestion on presentation - when demonstrating a task, it would be good to know at the start what we're trying to to achieve. The presenter took us through a series of simple data manipulation exercises step by step, and he was great at explaining them, but it wasn't always clear what the end goal would be. If we know the result we're going for rather than just following along with the demonstrated steps and finding out where it leads, then our problem-solving brains are engaged instead of just rote memory. It's much easier to learn and retain knowledge that way. I also recognise that it must be hard to lead an engaging workshop when all the participants have their cameras off, so he did a great job considering. I think it would be fair to ask everyone to keep them on. Thanks and hope to attend a more advanced version in future.",Online,SR,LTU,EXCEL101,,2022,3,7,31,Tue,12,9,Solo,1,Excel,44768_LTU_EXCEL101

I also missed more explanation of why we were doing what we were doing and why we were using the functions we were using. Otherwise it's just typing. I enjoyed most of the course and everyone was very helpful answering questions, but in a way I feel like a lot of the fundamentals were overlooked or not mentioned.

The videos are great, but this made REDcap feel a lot less onerous.
Small bit of feedback...I'm not sure if its feasible but separating the ""setup"" and ""data reports/export"" components of the presentation may have been more useful for me personally. Or alternatively, running a short ""refresher"" on how to do the ""data reports/export"" component. I'd love to revisit the ""data reports/export"" component on its own, at a later date, when I have actual data to download. However, I do recognise that some mention of ""data reports/export"" needs to be made when teaching us how to setup, as we need to know where the survey is going.

Alternatively, you could change the visualisations into those used by researchers to confirm assumptions of the data, such as scatter plots. In that way, students won't be quite so concerned with the presentation of the plots. Manuscript ready plots are quite difficult to create and probably should have their own course.",9,"I find that statistical programming training for researchers attempt to start at the beginning as if they were learning 'how to program', rather than how to use a new and more flexible tool to obtain statistical results. I feel that this is unnecessary. Researchers often just want to be able to do small things straight away, such as looking at differences between two groups. As confidence is gained in using the software, the user can then explore ways of doing things, as required, through self-discovery (i.e., simple Google searches). That way the researcher slowly develops into a programmer and expands their ability to use the tool within their work.",Online,GC,UOA,PYTHON101,,2022,3,8,36,Tue,32,23,Packaged,1,Python,44803_UOA_PYTHON101

My understanding was that students are expected to have attended the prerequisite courses and that if they have trouble with that material, they should seek help during or after those pre-req courses, or separately in a breakout room. I feel that if we had not needed to go over basic variables and functions from the pre-req courses, the second day of data visualisation would not have been as rushed and could even have allowed the explanation of a further data visualisation method (different graph) or more manipulative tools.",10,"This course did finish a few minutes early on each day, but I felt that the instructor rushed through the code at times, especially in the last hour, and relied on copying and pasting their code into the chat in order for people to keep up. I was following along with the code myself and this became really difficult when the pace lifted without explanatory comments being added to the code. Also, if other students had done as I had to do and used 2 devices (one for zoom and one to code), copying code from the chat is not possible. In my opinion, students should be able to follow along by typing it out themselves, which I usually have been able to. This helps with understanding and pacing. No comments were added by the instructor during coding towards the end of the second training day, which also made it difficult to keep up as I tried to add some of my own comments to explain what was happening, and if I missed the explanation for even one or two lines it was difficult to know what had happened.
During the course, I think it would be great if questions could be managed by the co-hosts, rather than the lead instructor, as having the lead instructor constantly stopping to read and answer questions can make it a bit disjointed. If a question is relevant to the whole group, a cohost could then tell the lead instructor.",Online,CF,UOA,R203,,2022,3,9,37,Tue,33,27,Packaged,1,R,44810_UOA_R203

You guys are fantastic at gently repeating things three ways, I always notice it and appreciate the way you do it. It's never condescending, and always feels supportive. 

The way mods three and four used different sets didn't seem to present an issue for this group, but I was holding my breath each time in case folks had difficulty opening them. Be worth pasting these links before the break in case of difficulty?

I realise there is not a lot that can be done about this type of person attending courses, but I would support if Intersect instructors reiterated that the courses are an introduction only, and if people were asked to hold off from putting their own code in the chat unless they have an error, or until the instructor specifically asks for examples of how people did an exercise.

There needs to be a disclaimer about participant being mindful of interruption and figuring things out.  Two people in the course were very disruptive i.e., constantly interrupting and the issues was that they had followed the instructions accurately. One of them even admitted to answering a phone call. They would literally say disrupt the class and then few seconds later say on that ok. Basic functioning computer literacy is that Even when the instructor was very clear and had check points. I think there needs to be better leadership and let people know to follow the instructions. The problems with this is that the time spent on more important things such as the second part of the course was lost.  It was clear people had other questions about NVivo and analysis that were raised halfway as someone else asked about matrixes etc when the time was running out. You cannot let on or wo people hold the class back. RESOLUTION: Breakout room, having people put their hand up; Announce at the beginning about “be mindful of everyone learning with questions and issues.”  “Participation, if you are speaking a lot then step down: Step up or step down”. Even saying we are aware of the time. The time allocation between the first and second part of the course is very poor at All training by intersect.

Good to allow myself to have the time to work through a set procedure for using SLURM.","I wonder if the file xfer training took up too much time. There is a file xfer mechanism built into mobaxterm, that we all use all the time. Probably wasn't necessary to outline another tool to do file xfer.",8,"I'm dave.creelman@environment.nsw.gov.au, couldn't work out how to update this as that email user.

This course was very useful for me to have pre-allocated time to sit down and get more familiar with corners of SLURM that I've not come across.

I think some of the course participants here were very familiar with SLURM and the SDC HPC environment. For some of them, this course may have been too elementary (my opinion, please check with others). I can get straightforward things done using SLURM pretty well already (srun, squeue, scontrol), but learning about sbatch in more depth was useful for me (didn't know about scancel for instance).

I'd cut out the part on file xfer. I use mobaxterm for file xfer, some use winscp. A fair amount of time was spent looking at FileZilla and it didn't want to work easily and is yet one more tool... that we probably won't use :-). 

Do you have another course on data presentation? Would it be worth talking about python DataSette or jupyter for presenting data directly from SDC, rather than downloading it? Nearly everything could be presented via web interfaces these days, sometimes there needs to be downloads or transfers, but would be good to know how to do everything from SDC via web.

The ....diff utility (goodiff ?) that was oulined in the course was flashed up on the screen, but I was in ""listen"" mode before I knew that I needed to enter it into a script. It may have been in a set of files that I missed downloading (I got there late), but I wasn't able to get it going and there didn't seem to be time to ask a question about it.

I'd recommend making the /home/zhaoj/ folder read for group (and maybe even other, since it's just training data?) so we can copy needed pre-downloaded files from there, rather than doing our own wget (which I found error prone and time consuming).

Recommend setting up VSCode (or having it setup a prereq of this course? ..and maybe other courses?) to connect to SDC and working with it rather than flicking between gedit and command line. Instructor seemed a little disappointed that he couldn't have code and a terminal visible at the same time. I found that hard on the watching end too. VSCode will let you edit the file and interact with a terminal in the same window. Many of us use this tool to work with code on SDC. It's free and will work on machines that don't have admin access (which is how most training participants laptops will be setup).

The instructor (pardon, forgot his name) wanted to use tmux, but didn't know that there is a module tmux available in the SDC modules environment. I'd recommend perhaps walking through the training with someone from DPE before starting a course so that these gaps can be covered. Might have been good to outline how to open a module that is dependant on other modules? This happens on SDC modules.

WRT deleting old log files (there was a question from the learners), rm has a -r option (recurse subdirectories) if you need to (indiscriminately) delete log files under directories. The instructor talked about entering each log subdirectory name as a param to rm. I think this is a bit manual. Might be good to talk about the exec subcommand of find too.

I use xargs to run processes through SLURM via srun. For some jobs this is super useful. I'd throw that in as an option for some job types. 

In the course I was building small for loops and functions to automate some extra logging into the log files (was hard to see where each output screed was coming from without echoing the input filename).

Multicore/Multiprocess jobs were mentioned, but there wasn't any mention of how to use these features from code. This is possibly outside the realm of this course, but it would have been good to have some pointers of where to look (Python examples maybe?) about how to use this from code. An internal tool's run time went from 7 days to 1 day by using Dasq I think? It may become even faster using GPU processing. Would be good to mention that this is possible (even though outside the scope of this course).

This is a fair bit of feedback :-). This was a useful course for me and I think it could be even better. I hope the DPE<->Intersect cooperation can be helped by these comments.",InPerson,TA,DPE,HPC202,,2022,4,12,50,Wed,22,17,Packaged,1,HPC,44902_DPE_HPC202

Instructor went a bit fast, particularly early on. I noticed several ""speed polls"" coming up, so I'm guessing it wasn't just me :-)
I think it would be okay to slow it down a little to ensure we understand the material too. There were a couple of times that the instructor seemed to imply ""if you don't ask questions, I don't know where you're at"". This is absolutely true and is hard to gauge well with an online session. Might be good to find a way of suggesting this in such a way that even the slowest person in the group would feel comfortable asking a question.

I think it would be useful if there was some way of having a progressing copy the instructors code put somewhere that is easier to access via Copy/Paste than the Zoom chat window. Perhaps a Google doc that is updated with the latest snippets of code? We of course shouldn't get the whole notebook at the beginning of each session, but I had to drop out of the session a few times and it was a touch annoying catching up via copy/paste... Thanks Jianzhou for doing this for me. It was good to have the extra help provided by Jianzhou (and the other fellow whose name I've forgotten!!). Thanks. 

A few times there were some questions that seemed to be pushed to the side from my perspective. From my perspective, some of the questions perhaps suggested that one of the questioners was a bit behind with getting the topic and may have even needed a bit more background learning? It would be good to have some way of working this out and providing help, perhaps from the assistants, which may have happened behind the scenes. Hopefully the questioner can have some courses suggested for them to bridge their knowledge gap. I think this is challenging to do in a sensitive way, but if done properly would build the trust and abilities of the learner wonderfully.

It was a very useful course. Thanks, Dave dave.creelman@environment.nsw.gov.au",Online,TK,DPE,PYTHON203,,2023,1,3,11,Tue,33,28,Packaged,1,Python,44999_DPE_PYTHON203

In the second half of the course, some of the instructions could have been better demonstrated. At some points the instructor clicked through a series of options quickly and it difficult to follow because the buttons/options selected weren't described particularly clearly.
In a situation where you need to click through 4+ options in a sequence, it is always good to demonstrate once at normal pace to show the outcome, then repeat the sequence a little more slowly so anyone who missed some the first time can follow the second time.",9,,Online,HP,UNSW,NVIVO101,,2023,1,3,12,Fri,31,25,Packaged,0.5,NVivo,45009_UNSW_NVIVO101

It didn't go into any depth at all that I haven't been able to teach myself and that furthered my practical skills in a meaningful way. I would limit revision to 30 mins at most. Having said that, what was taught would have certainly been helpful to a beginner and the instructor's explanations were very clear. It is probably not helpful to qualify the use of some functions in python as ""likely not being very useful"", that is a personal opinion, and I would think that one should encourage the idea that functions can certainly be very useful in the right context, especially when teaching beginners, so as to not limit their tool kit.",Online,GC,UniSA,PYTHON203,,2023,2,4,14,Tue,12,12,Packaged,1,Python,45020_UniSA_PYTHON203

A couple things the instructor could do to help might be to enlarge the screen he is sharing (bump up the mag). I resized the window to make it as large as possible, but on my laptop screen, the code he was writing was small. Second, the instructor could minimize the amount of times he scrolled up when referencing something we previously did and linger on the new code of an extra beat to give us a chance to follow along. often I would have most of the line typed in, but miss something and be unable to run it myself until the code was dropped into the chat. The code in the chat is a nice way for people who are really behind to catch up, but learning from cut and pasting is not nearly as good as typing it in yourself.
